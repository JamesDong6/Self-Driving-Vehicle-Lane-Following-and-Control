# Self-Driving-Vehicle-Lane-Following-and-Control
This repo provide a autonomous driving lane-keeping algorithm using computer vision and PID controller, and implementde on a PiCar. Pease see the following for the usage of the code:
```
$ python main.py
```
* main.py: main file for the algorithm.
* camera.py: live camera view.
* test_wheels.py: test PiCar motors (speed and turns).
* lane_detection.py: test computer vision part for real-time detection

Please refer to [PiCar-V](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-v/en/latest/) and [PiCar-V Git](https://github.com/sunfounder/SunFounder_PiCar-V) for the details of PiCar setup.
